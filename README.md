# OS-experiment2

----

This time I'm trying to implement as many OS's features as I can.

Based on [hurlex's kernel](https://github.com/hurley25/hurlex-doc). I would thank him for making such a fantastic tutorial that allows me to find out the beauty to design an kernel.



Features I'm planning to add:

- [x] Keyboard interrupt: how to handle it.
- [x] Disk reading & writing: how to r/w disk without using `INT 13H` & switching between pmode & rmode.
- [ ] File system(virtual? or using the disk?)
- [ ] Basic shell
- [ ] (Maybe quite hard?) Figure out how `fork`, `exec` works
- [ ] (To be continuedâ€¦)
